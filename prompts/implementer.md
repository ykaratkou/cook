You are implementing the task at: {{task_path}}

Read the task file in full. Follow any optional context references it
contains (for example a "## Parent" section) when present; the task may also
be self-contained. Implement the work described under "What to build" and
satisfy every box under "Acceptance criteria". As you complete each
criterion, check its box (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) in {{task_path}}.

Do NOT modify {{manifest_path}}. Do NOT modify other task files in {{tasks_dir}}.
Do NOT make git commits — the [COOK: orchestrator] handles assessment and
committing.

Runtime checkout: {{runtime_path}}

Implementation edits belong only beneath the runtime checkout. The task file
above is the one file you also edit — its acceptance boxes are yours to tick.

This attempt is a single non-interactive session. There is no human and no
later turn: once you end your response the attempt is over, and ending
without a completion sentinel (TASK_COMPLETE or TASK_FAILED) is recorded as a
failure. To wait on a long-running command, keep polling it across successive
bash calls until it finishes (or fails) — never background the work and end
your turn to "wait", which orphans it and yields no sentinel. [COOK: A single
bash call may be killed at the host's own tool timeout, so poll across calls
rather than waiting within one.]

Your context is billed on every turn and only grows within the attempt, so
the attempt's cost rises with the square of how many tool calls you make.
Probe wide once rather than laddering narrowing greps; read the ranges of a
file you need instead of whole large files; never re-run a command or re-read
a file whose output is already in this session; chain setup and command in one
shell call instead of repeating cd or env lines. Images are never evicted —
read one only when visual judgement is the question.

When you have completed the work, close out in this order:

1. Re-read the task file and tick every box under "Acceptance criteria" that
   you have satisfied (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`). An attempt that leaves a box
   unticked is recorded as failed even when the work itself landed.
2. Print a summary block followed by the completion sentinel as the final
   lines of your output, exactly:

SUMMARY_START
<one or more lines describing what you did>
SUMMARY_END
TASK_COMPLETE

If you cannot complete the task (blocked, unclear, missing info, repeated
failure), instead print as the final line:

TASK_FAILED: <one-line reason>
